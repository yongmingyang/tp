## Project: Medmoriser

Medmoriser is a desktop app to help medical students organise, memorise and revise their content. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=jonfoocy)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` (1 release) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored AddressBook-Level3 code for v1.2
    * Changed classes, variables and other instances of `Name` → `Question`, `AddressBook` → `Medmoriser` [\#38](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/38).

  * Added the ability to hide answers from the main view [\#57](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/57), [\#136](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/136)
    * What it does: Allows the user to hide the answer when browsing the list of QAndAs
        1. `list` which allows to user to view all QAndAs, with questions and answers all visible.
        2. `list questions` which allows the user to view all QAndAs, with questions visible and answers hidden.
    * Justification: Gives the user the flexibility to choose the preferred mode of viewing, 
    and to prevent seeing the answer before quizzing.
    * Added new test cases to ensure the new functionality worked in conjunction with existing features [\#60](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/60), [\#136](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/136)
