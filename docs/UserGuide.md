## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add q/QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add q/What is the heart responsible for?`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `q/QUESTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/What is the heart responsible for t/cardiology` or as `q/What is the heart responsible for`.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/heart`, `t/heart t/cardiology` etc.

*  `edit 2 q/What is the heart t/` Edits the question of the 2nd Q&A to be `What is the heart` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating questions/answers/tags by keywords: `find` (by: Yong Ming Yang)

If you would like to search the database, you can do so in a few ways:

1. Find Q&A with **questions** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find q/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2`

2. Find Q&A with **answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2`

3. Find Q&A with **tags** containing any of the given keywords. 
    Keywords for tags can have spaces. This requires the text to have an exact match (case-insensitive).

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2`

4. Find Q&A with **questions or answers** containing any of the given keywords.

    Format: `find a/KEYWORD`, for 2 or more words: `find q/KEYWORD1, KEYWORD2`

Examples:
* `find q/lung, disease` - finds questions with the word lung and/or disease
* `find a/vessels` - finds answers with the word vessels
* `find t/anatomy, Nervous System` - finds question sets tagged with the word anatomy or Nervous System (can be both)
* `find infection` - finds question and/or answers with the word infection

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

If you want to reset the database, this command helps to clear all entries from the question book.

If you're done with your work, this command allows you to exit the program.

### Saving the data

You don't need to worry about saving data manually, as Medmoriser data is automatically saved in the hard disk after any command that changes the data.

If you don't need certain questions anymore, you can archive them to declutter your workspace.
